# odin-recipes
Welcome to my first public GitHub repository! This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) curriculum, where Iâ€™m learning the fundamentals of web development. This repository contains a simple HTML based recipe webpage.

## Project Overview

This project is a basic recipe webpage built using HTML. It serves as an introduction to structuring content on the web and demonstrates my understanding of fundamental HTML concepts. The webpage includes:

- A main heading for the recipe title.
- An image of the finished dish.
- A description of the recipe.
- Ingredients listed in an unordered list.
- Step-by-step instructions in an ordered list.

## Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I have demonstrated the following skills:

-**HTML Basics**: Understanding of HTML syntax, tags, and elements.
- **Content Structuring**: Ability to organize content using headings, paragraphs, lists, and images.
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of semantic tags to structure the webpage meaningfully.
- **Git and GitHub**: Basic version control skills, including creating a repository, committing changes, and pushing code to GitHub.
